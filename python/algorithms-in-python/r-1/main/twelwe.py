"""
Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function choice(data) that returns a random element from a non-empty sequence. The random module in- cludes a more basic function randrange, with parameterization similar to the built-in range function, that return a random choice from the given range. Using only the randrange function, implement your own version of the choice function.
